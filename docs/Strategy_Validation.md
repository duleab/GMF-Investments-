# Strategy Validation for GMF Investments

## Overview
This notebook implements a comprehensive backtesting framework to validate the portfolio optimization strategies developed in the previous phase. We'll compare the performance of our optimized portfolios against benchmark strategies and analyze risk metrics to determine the viability of our investment approach.

## 5. Visualize Backtesting ResultsWe'll visualize the performance of our portfolio strategies over the backtesting period.




## 8. Export Validation ResultsWe'll export the validation results for reporting and further analysis.




## 9. Conclusion

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive backtesting framework to validate our portfolio optimization strategies. The key findings are:

1.  **Performance Comparison**: We compared the performance of our optimized portfolios (Maximum Sharpe Ratio and Minimum Volatility) against benchmark strategies (Equal Weight and 60/40).
2.  **Risk-Return Analysis**: We analyzed the risk-return tradeoff of each strategy to determine the most efficient allocation.
3.  **Risk Metrics**: We calculated comprehensive risk metrics including Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, and Value at Risk.
4.  **Strategy Viability**: We assessed the viability of our investment approach based on historical performance.

The validation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our portfolio optimization approach and provide valuable insights for investment decision-making.
